Scalable Architecture for Javascript Applications

## Features
* [RequireJS](requirejs.org/docs/download.html) to modularize your code and run everything on demand,
* Abstraction layer through [core.js](https://github.com/op1ekun/SAJA/blob/master/app/core.js) module,
* Sandbox module utilizing [Facade Pattern](http://addyosmani.com/largescalejavascript/#facadepattern) to hide complicated core functionalities from modules and enable only what is necessary,
* [Mediator Pattern](http://addyosmani.com/largescalejavascript/#mediatorpattern) to decouple modules logic and enable easy communication
